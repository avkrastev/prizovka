Software system for managing and control of serving subpoenas

## Getting Started

The main cases of use are that the system creates addresses whose coordinates are encoded in the so-called matrix (QR) codes. Once an employee scans this code, the subpoena (its distribution address) is assigned to it and appears into the list of summonses. These subpoenas, which are tied to specific addresses, may then form the shortest delivery route. Other important instances of use are related to easy access to the address history and address visits, as well as statistics measuring of the number of key business-specific indicators.
